### Example AI Interactions

```
User: "Explain the chain rule"
AI: "The Chain Rule is crucial for composite functions! If y = f(g(x)), 
     then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) ¬∑ g'(x)..."

User: "How do I find the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0?"
AI: "This is a famous limit! As x‚Üí0, sin(x)/x = 1. Here's why..."

User: [Uploads image of a calculus problem]
AI: "I can see this is a related rates problem involving a cone. 
     Let me break down the solution step by step..."

User: "Help me with optimization problems from Chunk 6"
AI: "Optimization problems follow a systematic approach. First, identify 
     what you're maximizing or minimizing..."
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI Assistant not connecting:**
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running (`ollama serve`)
- Check that port 11434 is not blocked
- Verify at least one model is downloaded
- Click the CONNECT button to test the model

**Vision features not working:**
- Use a vision-capable model (gemma, llava, etc.)
- Check the vision status indicator (eye icon)
- Ensure images are under 10MB
- Try different image formats (PNG, JPG)

**Formulas not rendering:**
- Check browser console for KaTeX errors
- Ensure LaTeX syntax is correct in modulesData.ts
- Verify KaTeX CSS is loaded

**Performance issues:**
- Use smaller models (7B) for faster responses
- Reduce image sizes before uploading
- Close unused browser tabs

### Performance Tips

- **Model Selection**: Smaller models (7B) are faster but less capable
- **Memory Usage**: Larger models require more RAM
- **Response Speed**: Adjust temperature and max_tokens in ollamaService.ts
- **Image Size**: Compress images before uploading for faster analysis

## üì± Mobile Support

The app is fully responsive and works on mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly interface
- Resizable AI assistant sidebar
- Optimized formula rendering
- Drag and drop image support
- Swipe gestures supported

## ü§ù Contributing

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices
